Hello, Internet! My name is Christopher Chapline and this is my blog! I'm currently a Sophomore studying computer science at the University of Arizona. My interests are in software development and the mathematics of computer science.


In my spare time, I rock climb, program, play video games, and listen to music. I try as often as I can to investigate new programming languages and paradigms. When I'm not busy, I try to maintain a list of active/semi-active projects that I'm currenlty working on/thinking about.

At the moment, those include:

* [JFaker](http://github.com/gizmo385/JFaker): A fake data generation library that is based on a [similar library written in Python](http://github.com/joke2k/faker/). This project is still in an early stage of data migration and formulation.
* A rewrite of [The Four Nations](http://github.com/gizmo385/TheFourNations), a civilization management game that was created in a couple months for a class project. My desire is to rewrite it in a more modularized fashion, allowing for more extensibility and less rigidity in the design.
* Small experiments with Java reflection and dynamic code generation such as the projects that I worked on for the [2014 University of Arizona ACM Hackathon](http://github.com/dkothari777/Hackathon2014) and [LAHacks](http://github.com/jano017/LaHacks).


I am always open to the possibility of working with others on these projects, so if anyone is interested, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:cachapline8@gmail.com)!

Thanks for reading!
