Hello, Internet! My name is Chris and this is my blog! I'm currently a Senior
studying computer science at the University of Arizona. My interests are in programming languages,
software development, and how different language paradigms can be used to express solutions to
problems that might otherwise be difficult.

In my spare time, I rock climb, program, play video games, and listen to music. I try as often as I
can to investigate new programming languages and paradigms. When I'm not busy, I try to maintain a
list of active/semi-active projects that I'm currently working on/thinking about.

At the moment, those include:

* [Experiments with Clojure](https://github.com/gizmo385/LearningClojure): LISP has always
  interested me and I finally decided to dive headfirst into Clojure this past year. While the
  progress has been slow due to time constraints, I can always go back to it for an eye-openner.

* Several different hackathon projects from the past few years including:
  - [JSFiddle for Java (ACM 2014 Hackathon)](https://github.com/dkothari777/Hackathon2014)
  - [A web app for Java unit testing (LAHacks 2014)](https://github.com/jano017/LaHacks)
  - [Data structure visualization (ACM 2015 Hackathon)](https://github.com/gizmo385/ACM-2015-hackathon)
  - [Real time twitter visualization (ViaSat 2015 Intern Hackathon)](https://github.com/gizmo385/Glimpse)

* Actively maintaing a set of comprehensive vim, bash, and zsh
  [dotfiles](https://github.com/gizmo385/dotfiles) that are publicly available, forkable, and
  maintainable. Feel free to download the installation script
  [here](https://github.com/gizmo385/dotfiles/blob/master/update_dotfiles)

I am always open to the possibility of working with others on these projects, so if anyone is
interested, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:cachapline8@gmail.com)!

Thanks for reading!
