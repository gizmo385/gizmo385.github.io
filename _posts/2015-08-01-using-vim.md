An overview of my Vim workflow and talking about why I keep coming back to the editor time after
time.

### Not *another* Vim post!

Posts about the advantages and disadvantages of Vim as an editor for getting work done have been
featured on damn near every programmer blog in existence - seriously
[they](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html)
[are](http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/03/21/why-vim/)
[freaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/338tx5/vim/cqiyma2)
[everywhere](https://pascalprecht.github.io/2014/03/18/why-i-use-vim/). All of these posts do
a great job of introducing the concept of modal editing and discussing why you, as a developer,
should take the time to learn how to use Vim (even if its only the basics). However, I want to spend
this blog post talking about how I use Vim and how Vim helps me get my job done.

### Plugin managers are seriously the best

One of the most common issues that I see beginners having when they first start using Vim is
figuring out how to sift through the mountain of plugins and find the truly standout ones.
Furthermore, once I find one of these diamonds in the rough, how can I ensure that my version of
the plugin is kept up to date without having to manually keep track of each individual plugin that
you've installed? The answer, as both the title of this section suggests and those who have
worked in Vim for a reasonable amount of time will know, is a plugin manager. Generally speaking,
there are three popular plugin managers that get all the attention:
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
[Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), and
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). While I personally prefer Vundle out of the
bunch, each does its job incredibly well and doesn't stand in the way of your workflow or interrupt
you for updates when you don't want it to.

Regardless of which plugin manager you decide to go with, the inclusion of one into your vim
workflow will make your life much easier.

### Keybindings that just make sense

I am a huge fan of most of the default bindings in vim. For the majority of the actions that I find
myself doing while editing, the default bindings are always nearby and are never a strain to reach
or remember in the moment. However, there are a few non-default bindings that I would argument make
life much easier:

* Exit insert mode with ``jj`` by mapping it to ``<ESC>``

* Change your leader to something like ``,`` or ``<Space>``

* Mapping ``;`` to ``:`` in normal mode to make commands easier

* Drop your arrow keys by mapping them to ``<nop>``

These are just a couple of the bindings
[that I use](https://github.com/gizmo385/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/.vim_bindings.vim) and that
I feel make my development lifecycle move much faster.

### Lightweight plugins for everything

People are usually nervous to stick with Vim because it isn't as fully-featured as many
mainstream IDEs out of the box. But many of the features that you yearn for in an IDE are easily
replaced by lightweight Vim plugins that port the features but don't sacrifice on one of vim's
greatest advantages - its speed! Here are a couple of examples:

* Want a file browser? Try out [Nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) or
[Unite](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) will do the job.

* Fuzzy file finder?
[Ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) has got ya covered!

* Editing LISP code? Try [Paredit](https://github.com/vim-scripts/paredit.vim) and
[Rainbow Parenthesis](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim).

Alongside these more common editor features, I have a few plugins that I frequently use that I
don't often see featured in more commonplace development environments, such as
[actually decent git integration](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) or automatic building
[markdown previews](https://github.com/shime/vim-livedown). Even if the plugin that your heart
truly desires isn't available, there is nothing holding you back from writing one yourself! I've
spent the past few days working on a plugin to
[control Spotify from vim](https://github.com/gizmo385/spotify.vim), allowing me to play and
control my music without [breaking my concentration](http://i.imgur.com/Ssz6pjF.png) while vim
isn't necessary known for its stellar scripting language, most plugins can be handled by doing the
heavy lifting in a langauge like Ruby or Python.

A vast suite of plugins coupled with the fact that the installation is no more difficult than
a .vimrc entry leads to what is probably my favorite reason to use vim...

### Quick and easy configuration deployment

It is generally safe to assume that any system that you use will include a Vim installation. This
makes incredibly easy to package up your Vim configuration and transfer it quickly and easily to
a new machine in a moments notice. It makes transitioning to a new system or SSHing into a new
machine a much less painful experience because the development environment that you have come to
know can come along with you an make it like it you never left your home machine. In
[my dotfiles](https://github.com/gizmo385/dotfiles), I have a
[shell script](https://github.com/gizmo385/dotfiles/blob/master/update_dotfiles) that I use that
automatically downloads and copies over my dotfiles for vim, bash, and zsh. This is quite possibly
one of the my most treasured utilities as a developer. Being able to detach myself from any single
development machine affords me freedom as a developer that I don't think you could easily replicate
in an IDE.

### Wrapping up

Overall, Vim provides me with a development experience that I don't think is easily replicated
by other editors (Emacs being an exception to this rule). It provides me with mobility as a deveoper
that frees me from any particular machine to do my work and allows me to quickly and freely explore
different plugin environments and workflows without having to worry about resetting my configuration
and figuring it all out again.

I would recommend that any developer who is tired of digging through settings dialogs trying to find
that perfect configuration for that single editor for that single language platform give Vim (or
Emacs) a shot.
