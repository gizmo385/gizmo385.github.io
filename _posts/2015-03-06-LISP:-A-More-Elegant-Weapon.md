title: LISP: A More Elegant Weapon
---

I recently gave [a talk](http://uofa-acm.github.io/2015/01/29/why-is-lisp-different/) to my [university's ACM chapter](http://uofa-acm.github.io) talking about what makes LISP different and why those differences are powerful. In the coming weeks, I will work on putting together a more long-form blog post that will work as an extension to my talk.

The slides for this talk are available [here](http://slides.com/gizmo385/the-land-of-lisp#/).
