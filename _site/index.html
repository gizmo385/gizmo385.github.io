        Summer Projects
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>

    <p>Like many other college students around the country, I&#39;m going to be on summer break starting in a few weeks. Along with summer break comes more free time and more time to focus on personal projects. Due to this anticipated free time, I&#39;ve decided that I want to look into starting and finishing a personal project from scratch that will be on a larger scale than the personal projects that I&#39;ve previously worked on. My current idea is to write a parser for a language (one that I don&#39;t currently know) in that language.</p>

<p>At the moment, I&#39;m looking into various LISP dialects as my &quot;goto&quot; language to do this with, but I&#39;m still unsure. I&#39;ve also considered the possibility of looking into a purely functional language and writing my parser for that (this language would likely be something with a less steep learning curve than a language like Haskell). In addition to that, I&#39;m going to be trying to get some heavy reading done on a few topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graph theory</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>Parsing</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
<li>Linear algebra</li>
<li>Abstract Algebra</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two topics in that list are of uptmost importance and the second two are likely to come along with the nature of my project idea. Outside of personal projects, I am also taking on an internship at <a href="http://www.elegantthought.com/">Elegant Thought</a> for the summer, where I will be doing Android development. I&#39;m also taking 2 courses at the university, one of which is a programming course that focuses on the more creative aspects of programming (Markov Chains, etc) and is in <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, this summer is shaping up to be a rather substantial workload, but a workload that I will enjoy. I would also recommend that other students around the country take the newly found free time to open up a couple personal projects or look into contributing to some open source repositories online. Getting more experience never hurt anyone!</p>

      <a href="/2014/04/28/java-8/">
        Why you should be using Java 8
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Java 8 was recently released by Oracle and included a large number of improvements and new features that are poised to have the biggest impact on the platform since the introduction of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">generics</a> in Java 5.</p>

<h2>When did this become a thing?</h2>

<p>Java 8 was released to the general public on March 18th, 2014, although the features included in the version had been in development for several years after the specification for the update (<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=337">JSR 337</a>) was being worked on in the later months of 2010.</p>

<h2>So what&#39;s included in this update?</h2>

<p>As with every major version update, a large number of changes were made to the Java platform. The biggest changes that were announced, and the one&#39;s that we&#39;ll be discussing today, include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional interfaces and default methods</li>
<li>Lambda expressions</li>
<li>Method references</li>
<li>The Java Streaming API</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Interfaces</h2>

<p>Interfaces allow the encapuslation of a specific behavior into something a class must implement. This encapsulation will allow a programmer to uniformly handle any class that implements that interface without having to worry about type errors.</p>

<p>In Java 8, a new type annotation has been added:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="nd">@FunctionalInterface</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A functional interface must contain <strong>exactly one</strong> abstract method. This means that every other method declared in the interface must be given a <em>default</em> implementation. Enter default methods:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="nd">@FunctionalInterface</span> <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nc">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="lineno"> 3</span>     <span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="lineno"> 4</span> <span class="cm">     * This is our functional interface. It will take an input</span>
<span class="lineno"> 5</span> <span class="cm">     * and determine if that input matches the conditions</span>
<span class="lineno"> 6</span> <span class="cm">     * defined in the predicate.</span>
<span class="lineno"> 7</span> <span class="cm">     *</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span> <span class="cm">     * @param t The object to test against the predicate</span>
<span class="lineno"> 9</span> <span class="cm">     * @return True if the object satisfies the predicate and</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span> <span class="cm">     * returns false otherwise</span>

<span class="lineno">15</span> <span class="cm">     * This is a default method. Implementing the interface will</span>

<span class="lineno">28</span>                 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">test</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="lineno">29</span>             <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="lineno">30</span>         <span class="o">};</span>
<span class="lineno">31</span>         <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">predicate</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="lineno">32</span>     <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="lineno">33</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>An interface marked with the <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> annotation can have an unlimited number of default methods, but must have exactly one abstract method.</p>

<p>But is there any way that we can trim down on the verbosity?</p>

<h2>Lambda Expressions</h2>

<p>In Predicate example for functional interfaces, we could have also written our negate method as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno">1</span>     <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="n">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">negate</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno">2</span>         <span class="n">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">me</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="lineno">3</span>         <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno">4</span>             <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">test</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno">5</span>                 <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">test</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="lineno">6</span>             <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="lineno">7</span>         <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="lineno">8</span>     <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is called an anonymous class definition. It allows you to define a class without specifically assigning it to a variable. It is likely one of the ugliest and most verbose constructs in the Java programming langauge. It also doesn&#39;t have any performance benefits because every time you declare an anonymous class, the JVM must jump through the same hoops for object instantiation.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could clean this up a bit? This is where lambda expressions come in. Lambda expressions are essentially anonymous functions and they can be used to great effect to gain not only readability benefits, but performance increases as well. The standard form for a lambda expression is as follows:</p>

<p><code>(argument list) -&gt; {function body}</code></p>

<p>In the context of the Java platform, these can be used on <em>any functional interface</em> and the code in the <code>{function body}</code> will be the implementation for that functional interface&#39;s abstract method.</p>

<p>Using this, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t clean up that negate code a bit:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno">1</span>     <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="n">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">negate</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno">2</span>         <span class="n">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">me</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="lineno">3</span>         <span class="n">Predicate</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">negated</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">(</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="n">me</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">test</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">);</span>
<span class="lineno">4</span>         <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">negated</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="lineno">5</span>     <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, there are a few moving parts here so let&#39;s break it down:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>(t)</code>: This is the argument list for the Predicate interface&#39;s abstract method, test. That method takes one argument, of generic type <code>&lt;T&gt;</code>. Java&#39;s type system is smart enough to figure out the types of the items inside the argument list, so it is unnecessary to explicitly give them types.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-&gt;</code>: This separates the argument list from the function body. The arrow operator is something that is seen in many languages, especially in the context of functions and lambda expressions. You may, albeit rarely, hear this arrow referred to as the &quot;burger arrow&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p><code>(! me.test(t) );</code>: This defines the function body for the Predicates abstract method (test). In this case, it simply returns the negation of evaluating the input on ourselves.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now what about those performance increases that were vaguely alluded to earlier? Well in <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">Java 7</a>, they introduced a new bytecode instruction called <code>invokedynamic</code>. In a nutshell, the <code>invokedynamic</code> instruction allows for symbols to be bound at runtime which, in this case, allows us to execute the lambda&#39;s function body without spinning up a new class instance. This saves the JVM the time that it would have spent during the object instantiation phase and sped the process up. For a more detailed explanation of lambda expression compilation on the JVM, see <a href="http://www.takipiblog.com/2014/01/16/compiling-lambda-expressions-scala-vs-java-8/">this excellently detailed blog post</a> by Tal Weiss which discusses how Java 8 handles lambdas versus how Scala (another JVM language) handles them.</p>

<h2>Method References</h2>

<p>So what should I do if I want to pass a method to another method so that I don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel in my code? Well, then you pass a pass method to another method! In Java 8, they introduced method references, which allows for methods to be passed as an argument to functions. In most cases, this is generally syntactic sugar for a lambda expression. Suppose we are sorting a list of strings:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="n">Collections</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sort</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">strings</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">compareTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This could be rewritten using a method reference to the <code>compareTo</code> defined in the String class.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="n">Collections</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sort</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">strings</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nl">String:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">compareTo</span> <span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>The Streaming API</h2>

<p>The addition of the streaming API in Java 8 is arguably one of the most useful additions in the release. As defined by the Java 8 API, a stream is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much in the same way that you can use a for each loop to iterate over an iterable collection, you can now use streams to perform operations on the data as you go, possibly creating another stream in the process and eventually reducing into some desired result.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s tackle the problem of creating an array of all primes numbers in a list. For simplicity, we&#39;ll assume the existence of a method <code>isPrime(int)</code> that will return true iff the supplied integer is prime. Here is what a standard solution to this problem might look like:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno"> 1</span> <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">primesUnder</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno"> 2</span>     <span class="n">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ArrayList</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;();</span>
<span class="lineno"> 3</span>     <span class="k">for</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">Integer</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno"> 4</span>         <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">isPrime</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="lineno"> 5</span>             <span class="n">primes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="lineno"> 6</span>         <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="lineno"> 7</span>     <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="lineno"> 8</span> 
<span class="lineno"> 9</span>     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">primes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toArray</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">primes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">size</span><span class="o">()]</span> <span class="o">);</span>
<span class="lineno">10</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let&#39;s see how we could do this by using Streams:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">IntStream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">rangeClosed</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="lineno">2</span>                         <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">isPrime</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">)</span>
<span class="lineno">3</span>                         <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toArray</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This solution is much easier to read and as opposed to the standard iterative solution. However, this can still be improved. In the definition of a stream, it said that it supposed sequential <strong>and</strong> parallel operations - so which is this?</p>

<p>Well, by default, the creation of a stream will yield a stream that executes operations in a sequential fashion (non-parallel). However, creating a parallel stream is very simple. If we were to change our primes example so that it would execute in parallel, it would look like this.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="lineno">1</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">primes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">IntStream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">rangeClosed</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="lineno">2</span>                         <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">parallel</span><span class="o">()</span>
<span class="lineno">3</span>                         <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">isPrime</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">)</span>
<span class="lineno">4</span>                         <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">toArray</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it is as simple as that! However, be warned - for there be dragons! Parallel streams are <strong>not</strong> the solution to every problem and in some cases will actually cause performance to decrease as a result of the threading overhead. Try to reserve parallel streams for computationally intensive tasks that will actually benefit from parallelization.</p>

<p>As a final example, let&#39;s write a method that will take a list of files, load the images, rescale and rename those images, and then save them back to the disk. To shorten the length of this example, we&#39;re going to assume the existence of a few methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>loadImage(File f)</code>: Loads the image at the file or returns null if it is not an image.</p></li>
<li><p><code>saveImage(BufferedImage i)</code>: Saves the image to the disk with a name and ID.</p></li>

<p>As a final exercise, let&#39;s examine each statement and see what is going on in more detail:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>files.parallelStream()</code>: This creates a parallel stream of the files in the collection. This means that any operation carried out on this stream (and its derivatives) will be executed in parallel using a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html">fork/join</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map( f -&gt; loadImage(f) )</code>: This makes use of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order function</a> known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)">map</a> which applies a function to every item in the stream.</p></li>
<li><p><code>filter(Objects::nonNull)</code>: nonNull is a method defined in the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Object.html">Objects class</a>. This statement removes any objects from the list that are null.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map( f -&gt; getScaledImage( f, width, height )</code>: This scales all of the images in the stream to the specified height and width. This operations is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">Affine Transformation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>forEach( f -&gt; saveImage(f) )</code>: forEach performs an operation on every element in the stream. In this case, it saves the images to the disk.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Java 8 added tons of features, a few of which were discussed here, that have the potential to make large changes to the mainstream Java development stack. The conciseness (in terms of Java) that is possible allows for seemingly complex operations to be distilled down to their base parts and expressed effectively to developers who are reading your code. On top of the readability improvements, many of these changes also carry performance increases alongside them - which is difficult to pass up.</p>
