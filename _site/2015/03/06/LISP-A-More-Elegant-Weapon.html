<p>I recently gave <a href="http://uofa-acm.github.io/2015/01/29/why-is-lisp-different/">a talk</a> to my <a href="http://uofa-acm.github.io">university&#39;s ACM chapter</a> talking about what makes LISP different and why those differences are powerful. In the coming weeks, I will work on putting together a more long-form blog post that will work as an extension to my talk.</p>

<p>The slides for this talk are available <a href="http://slides.com/gizmo385/the-land-of-lisp#/">here</a>.</p>
